### About Me 
Hello! I am an experienced Art Educator and Studio Arts professional with over 4 years of proven expertise in Studio Arts, Photography, and Graphic Design. 


With skills in illustration, film and digital photography, mixed media sculpture, and graphic design, I am able to facilitate social- and environmental-justice focused art lessons for K -12 students, and achieve awards for my work in gallery showcases. I am adept at using the Adobe Creative Suite, film development and darkroom processes, and the Microsoft Office suite. 


My diverse skill set, commitment to equitable art education, and passion for creating make me a valuable asset. In my spare time, I like to work on my projects in the studio and spend time outdoors.

### Projects

#### Art Mart Inventory Manager
 - This spreadsheet keeps track of expenses, inventory, purchasing versus spending price, loans, and other business needs for an imaginary side hustle. Graphs and data analytics are included.

 - I created this project to keep track of expenses and inventory for a side hustle to keep track of my business’ money and change my spending as needed. I used Microsoft Excel to complete this project. I had trouble with figuring out the proper equations for calculating interest equations for my loan table, but relied on my knowledge of Excel from our practice assignments and previous iterations of this assignment to complete this project. I’m happy with how it turned out, and I don’t think I’d change anything.

#### Grade Calculator
 - This spreadsheet serves as a grade tracker and calculator for one of my classes. When I input grades for certain assignments, it calculates my weighted, unweighted, percentage, and letter grades for the course.

 - I created this grade tracker to keep track of my assignments and project my GPA based on my grades for certain projects. I used Microsoft Excel to complete this project. I had trouble getting my final letter grade to accurately reflect my individual assignment grades. I needed to reorganize the Grade Scale table to go from F-A instead of A-F to solve this problem. When I got stuck on the Grade Scale table, I collaborated with a friend of mine who is a Data Science major to help me figure out where I went wrong. He was able to point out my mistake and guide me in the right direction. I set out to create a user-friendly grade tracker so I could keep track of my grades and project what my final grades would be according to my individual grades. I feel I made a very cohesive and easy-to-use grade tracker that will serve me well in the future. I’d like to add more of my courses to this tracker in the future.

#### Flower Personality Quiz
 - This is a ten question quiz that assesses a user’s personality type to assign them a “flower personality” based on their answers. It uses loops, conditional statements, and error checking.

 - When I set out to design this project, my goal was to create a 10-question personality quiz using Python 3 that would utilize loops, conditional statements, and error checking to assign a user a flower personality type based on their answers to quiz questions. I used Python 3 hosted on JDoodle to complete this project. I struggled with the initial setup for this project, as there were many variables I had to cover - printing questions, converting the user’s answers into point values, error checking, and the final combination of points to supply the user with their result. Setting up commented sections to lay out where in the code I would put each variable was very helpful for me in this process. I think that laying out my sections before I started coding was critical to my success and helped me overcome my initial anxieties about the project. I relied on my knowledge of loops and conditions from class activities and homework assignments to complete this project. I set out to make a 10-question quiz that would assign a user their flower personality type based on their answers to my questions. I think I achieved this very well, and I learned a lot about loops and conditions along the way. If I were to take this further, I’d like to make more detailed questions and make the quiz a bit more accurate, making sure that users who answered in one category the most would always get that category, despite point value outliers.
